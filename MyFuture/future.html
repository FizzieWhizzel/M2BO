                I’d love to set up an indie game studio, working with friends to make a game we are truly passionate about. 
                After school I’d like to take a year or two to gain experience in the field, while working on my skills as a game dev. 
                Then, I’d start my own project. Maybe start by myself, and find people to work with along the way. Who knows.
